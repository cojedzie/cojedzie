# How to contribute?

Thanks for your interest in the project!

## I'd like to propose some feature / change...

Cool! Go ahead, [create an issue] and describe your proposal so anyone can see it. You can also vote on features that
you want the most.

## I've found a bug!

Well, less cool! Before creating an issue, please check if the bug remains after hard refreshing (usually `ctrl+F5`) the
application. If the answer is yes, or this is not the first encounter of it please [create an issue] and describe the
problem. If you can, please attach screenshots (especially if this is visual bug), and console logs (especially for
connection problems) - this will help to reproduce the problem.

## I've got some spare resources on my server...
Soon you will be able to help the project by hosting your own API node that will be available for clients to use. 
More details to come soon.

## I want to contribute some code...

That's great! If you want to make changes to API (which is responsible for collecting and supplying applicaiton with 
data) please check the [API contribution guidelines], if you are interested in UI side of the app please read the 
[frontend contribution guidelines].

### Contributor License Agreement

Unfortunately due to this project nature and license I need you to sign [Contributor License Agreement] - the nice thing
is that it can be done with simple push of a button! **You still will have full copyright to your contribution** but
basically you consent that you are entitled to code you are submitting and also to allow me to license this project on
other terms if needed to, for example, local governments. If you don't want to sign - I understand - but I won't be able
to accept your contribution :(
